- [ ] **Web Scraping**: Learn how to extract data from websites with Python.
- [ ] **Data Visualization**: Tell stories through data using charts and visual tools.



## 📓 **Markdown Syntax Cheat Sheet**  
Here’s my personal markdown cheat sheet for quick reference throughout the semester:

| **Markdown Element**  | **Syntax**                      | **Rendered Output**                          |

| Italic Text           | `*Italic Text*`                 | *Italic Text*                                |
| Link                  | `[GitHub](https://github.com)`  | [GitHub](https://github.com)                 |
| Image                 | `![Alt text](image_url)`        | ![Alt text](image_url)                       |
| Unordered List        | `- Item 1`                      | - Item 1                                     |
| Ordered List          | `1. First item`                 | 1. First item                                |
| Inline Code           | `` `print("Hello World!")` ``   | `print("Hello World!")`                      |
| Block of Code         | ```` ```python \n print() ``` ````| Python code block                           |
| Blockquote            | `> This is a quote.`            | > This is a quote.                           |
| Horizontal Rule       | `---`                           | ---                                          |



## 💡 **Inspiring Quote**  
_"Data is a precious thing and will last longer than the systems themselves."_ – Tim Berners-Lee  
This quote inspires me to focus on the enduring value of data and why organizing and modeling it matters.



## 🧑‍💻 **Verbatim Code Snippet**  
Here’s a simple Python snippet I’m already familiar with. It prints "Hello, World!" to the console:

```python
# Simple Python code to print "Hello, World!"
def greet():
    print("Hello, World!")
    
greet()
```



## 📊 **Three Other Markdown-Formatted Elements**  

### 📍 **1. Ordered List of Goals**  
1. Become proficient in data science tools.
2. Build practical projects with Python.
3. Improve collaborative skills using GitHub.



### 🔗 **2. Link to My GitHub Profile**

### 🗒 **3. Data Table Example**
A simple data table to keep track of various data science topics:

| **Topic**             | **Status**        | **Resources**                             |
