# DIS08-2024-Assignments: Lab 01 🧑‍💻

Welcome to my first Markdown-formatted file for **DIS08/OR92 Data Modeling**. Below you'll find everything required for this assignment: a to-do list, a personal markdown cheat sheet, an inspiring quote, code snippets, and more!



## ✅ **To-Do List**: What I Want to Learn This Semester  
These are the things I’ve heard about today and would like to master throughout the semester. I'll keep this list updated by checking off what I’ve learned.

- [ ] **GitHub**: Master version control and collaboration.
- [ ] **Markdown**: Get comfortable writing and formatting Markdown.
- [ ] **Command Line Interface (CLI)**: Use the terminal with confidence.
- [ ] **Regular Expressions (regex)**: Become proficient in pattern matching.
- [ ] **Python for Data Science**: Deepen my skills with Pandas, NumPy, and other libraries.
- [ ] **Web Scraping**: Learn how to extract data from websites with Python.
- [ ] **Data Visualization**: Tell stories through data using charts and visual tools.



## 📓 **Markdown Syntax Cheat Sheet**  
Here’s my personal markdown cheat sheet for quick reference throughout the semester:

| **Markdown Element**  | **Syntax**                      | **Rendered Output**                          |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Heading 1             | `# Heading 1`                   | # Heading 1                                  |
| Bold Text             | `**Bold Text**`                 | **Bold Text**                                |
| Italic Text           | `*Italic Text*`                 | *Italic Text*                                |
| Link                  | `[GitHub](https://github.com)`  | [GitHub](https://github.com)                 |
| Image                 | `![Alt text](image_url)`        | ![Cookies](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Chocolate_Chip_Cookies_-_kimberlykv.jpg)                       |
| Unordered List        | `- Item 1`                      | Can´t preview                                   |
| Ordered List          | `1. First item`                 | Can´t preview                                 |
| Inline Code           | `` `print("Hello World!")` ``   | `print("Hello World!")`                      |
| Block of Code         | ```` ```python \n print() ``` ````| Can´t preview                         |
| Blockquote            | `> This is a quote.`            | Can´t preview                         |
| Horizontal Rule       | `---`                           | Can´t preview                                         |



## 💡 **Inspiring Quote**  
>_"Data is a precious thing and will last longer than the systems themselves."_
> – Tim Berners-Lee

This quote inspires me to focus on the enduring value of data and why organizing and modeling it matters.



## 🧑‍💻 **Verbatim Code Snippet**  
Here’s a simple Python snippet I’m already familiar with.

```python
# This program calculates how much coffee you need to survive the semester! ☕️

def coffee_needed(assignments, exams):
    # Coffee is life! We assume 2 cups per assignment and 5 cups per exam.
    cups = (assignments * 2) + (exams * 5)
    return cups

assignments = 8
exams = 3

# Get the result with a cheeky comment
cups_of_coffee = coffee_needed(assignments, exams)
print(f"To survive this semester, you need approximately {cups_of_coffee} cups of coffee! 🚀☕")

# Fun message if you're over-caffeinated
if cups_of_coffee > 30:
    print("Warning: You might transform into a caffeinated coding machine! 💻🤖")

```
